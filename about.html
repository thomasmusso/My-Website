          <h2>Blockchain Background</h2>
          <p>Meet guest1.eth, a digital asset enthusiast and NFT collector. With over a year and a half of experience in the world of NFT trading, he has navigated the ups and downs of the industry with a keen eye for promising projects. He started off by researching and investing in various projects, but not without experiencing some setbacks in the form of rug pulls and unfulfilled promises.</p>
          <p>But, guest1.eth didn't let those early failures discourage him. Instead, he learned from them and continued to grow his knowledge and skills. One of the areas that caught his attention was ENS. Through research, Tom discovered the potential of minting valuable ENS names, and he was able to mint his own 4-digit ENS names, 2212.eth and 9673.eth, of which he still holds 2212.eth and has plans to sell it for 20 ETH one day.</p>
          <p>Guest1.eth's passion for NFTs and digital assets is evident, and he's always on the lookout for the next big thing in the industry.</p>
